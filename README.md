# Google Operational Research tools

## What does OR-Tools do?

Seeks to find the best solution to a problem out of a very large set of possible solutions.
Examples:

- Vehicle routing: Find optimal routes for vehicle fleets that pick up and deliver packages given constraints (e.g., "this 
truck can't hold more than 20,000 pounds" or "all deliveries must be made within a two-hour window").

- Scheduling: Find the optimal schedule for a complex set of tasks, some of which need to be performed before others, on a 
fixed set of machines, or other resources.

- Bin packing: Pack as many objects of various sizes as possible into a fixed number of bins with maximum capacities.

## OR-Tools includes solvers for

- Constraint Programming
- Linear and Mixed-Integer Programming
- Vehicle Routing
- Graph Algorithms
